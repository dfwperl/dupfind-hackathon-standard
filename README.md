dupfind

## DESCRIPTION

File deduplicator written in Perl as a proof-of-concept for the
Dallas/Fort Worth Perl Mongers Winter 2013 hackathon competition.

## BUGS/CAVEATS

This code doesn't handle hard links.  This proof of concept code
is meant to give you one way to approach the problem.  It is not
meant to give you a full solution (you need to make your own).

Hint: for handling symlinks, `perldoc -f lstat`
